# This is a thing
Just some quick and dirty empirical data suggesting that Japanese websites are indeed denser in terms of text than English equivalents. Sites were broken into 5 categories: E-Commerce, News, Multi-Purpose, Business and Blogs. 

Quick and dity because there's only one website per category and the text had to be manually highlighted in photoshop (or whatever). Black sections are text. White sections are large blank spaces along the edges of the website. All images were normalized to 1052 x 1500 because I ain't highlighting 9000 pixels worth of text boxes.

Output:
